One lazy Saturday morning, my dad came into the family room after my 10th episode of Friends and asked us a favor: to watch this Youtube video and follow along to the directions. My brother and I were ready to do something else, so we agreed. The Youtube video was about the basics of how to code Python. We were hesitant at first, but clicked play and listened. As the video progressed, I was hooked. I finished the video, leaving me with the fundamentals of Python, but I still wanted more. Ever since then, I have been so active in this field, continuously seeking to learn more. 

My dad has always pushed me to try to pursue this career, and I let it guide me, and soon enough, it became a passion. We have endless dinner conversations about the importance of women in technology. 

For winter break last year, I flew to San Francisco, California to meet with my dad's boss, the President of Sales at Palo Alto Networks. This meeting with her led me to realize how important and urgent this movement for more women in technology. This website's sole purpose is to get more girls like me to become more passionate about computer science. Because tech is so important and involved in any world, I believe everyone should at least have some knowledge of how computers work or how to build a website. This advocacy of mine has guided me to encourage more girls to learn the basics of coding. I know it's boring, but there are many ways to get creative with it! Technology is so important to the advancement of our future and has taken over how we do everyday tasks. The future is in our hands; so try new things!

Happy coding!
