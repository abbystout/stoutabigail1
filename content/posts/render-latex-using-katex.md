One lazy Saturday morning, my dad came into the family room after my 10th episode of Friends and asked us a favor: to watch this Youtube video and follow along to the directions. My brother and I were ready to do something else, so we agreed. The Youtube video was about the basics of how to code Python. We were hesitant at first, but clicked play and listened. As the video progressed, I was hooked. I finished the video, leaving me with the fundamentals of Python, but I still wanted more. Ever since then, I have been so active in this field, continuously seeking to learn more. 

My dad has always pushed me to try to puruse this career, and I finally listened to him. We would have endless dinner conversations about the importance of women in technology.
